To build the module manually, proceed as follows.

1. Install NEST from source.
1. Clone this repository to a location outside NEST's source code or
   build directories.
1. Create a build directory for the module outside its source
   directory and outside NEST source or build directories.
1. In the build directory, run

   cmake -Dwith-nest=<PATH TO NEST INSTALLATION>/bin/nest-config <PATH TO MODULE SOURCE DIR>
   make install

In NEST, run
